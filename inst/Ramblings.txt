The downstream spatial experiment object contains two assays, counts and exprs which correspond to the raw isotope abundances and the transformed (inverse hyperbolic sine, co-factor 5) counts, respectively. Both of these assays were corrected for spillover effects (see script 2_Spillover_Correction) and in the later downstream analysis are have the same names.

    

spatial communities split by primary vs recurrent
spatial communities split by regions where possible 


Proneural subtypes are more common in young patients, less pathological compared with proliferative or interstitial GBM and have a better prognosis.


IvyGAP - used laser capture microdissection to carefully delineate and individually generate niche-specific transcriptome of the five major histomorphologic features of glioblastoma:

Cellular Tumour (CT)
Infiltrating Region (IT) 
Microvascular Proliferation (MVP)
Tumour Cells around necrosis (PAN) 
adjacent leading edge brain tissue (LE) 

Microscopically, glioblastoma shows a reliable set of “hallmark” histomorphologic features that include 
tumor areas of high cellularity (CT),
brain infiltration (IT), 
microvascular proliferation (MVP) and 
hypoxia in which tumor cells form palisading structures around necrosis (PAN) in heterogenous quantities


Previously the authors and other had aligned histomorphologic features to the four plastic cellular states of glioblastoma and found enrichment of MES signature in PAN tumour regions

Methodology Notes:

RAW .mcd files exported from the MCD viewer were converted to multi-channel .tiff images using the Steinbeck "preprocess" command line tool from Steinbock0.13.5. The pixels were also hot-pixel filtered using the default recommended threshold of 50.
Hot pixel filtering works by comparing each pixel to its 8-neighborhood (i.e., neighboring pixels at a Chebyshev distance of 1). If the difference (not: absolute difference) between the pixel and any of its 8 neighbor pixels exceeds a hot pixel filtering threshold, the pixel is set to the maximum neighbor pixel value ("hot pixel-filtered").

cellpose does not install easily on a m1 mac and therefore the following steps are required:


To run cellpose on arm64:
I first install Napari and pyqt and generate the environment

conda create -y -n napari-env -c andfoy python=3.8 pyqt napari python.app

Then you need imagecodecs…

conda install -c conda-forge imagecodecs

Then cellpose…

python -m pip install cellpose



When running Astir it seems to be labelling large amount of cells as neurons which are expressing CD56 and Neun_Fox
